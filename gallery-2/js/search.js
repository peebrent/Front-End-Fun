Element.prototype.Search = function(){

var gallery = document.getElementById('gallery');
//gallery.getFilteredLis() or whatever we call it
//also want to use similar something to li.dataset.description = photo.description;
//also set the tags as data attributes
//maybe all should result in all photos
//data tags is a useful attribute
// log the photo variable and find where the tags are - steve recommend
//I added to the app on my own.  make lis show and hide based on input of the search

//when the user focuses on the input, clear its contents
//after the user presses enter or return, filter the gallery <li> using tags from the JSON model
